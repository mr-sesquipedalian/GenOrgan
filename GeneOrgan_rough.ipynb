      "      \"abstract\": \"BACKGROUND\\nSecondary anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation may occur in patients with advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer treated with ALK inhibitors, but its nature is not well-known.\\n\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nWe analyzed tumor specimens after the failure of treatment with ALK inhibitor(s) (crizotinib, alectinib, and ceritinib) for secondary ALK kinase domain mutation, EGFR, K-ras, and PIK3CA mutations. The literature regarding acquired ALK-inhibitor(s) resistance was also reviewed.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nAmong 59 patients who received ALK inhibitor(s) during the period of December 2010 to April 2015, 7 had re-biopsied tumor specimens for analyses following ALK inhibitor(s) failure. One had G1202R after crizotinib and alectinib failure, and 6 were wild type. No EGFR, K-ras, or PIK3CA mutations were found. In our review of the literature and taken together with our patients, 25 of the 88 (28%) patients with crizotinib failure had secondary ALK mutation; L1196M mutation was most common (n\\u00a0= 11). Patients with secondary ALK mutation other than L1196M had a longer progression-free survival after crizotinib than patients with L1196M (median, 12.0 vs. 7.0 months; P\\u00a0= .04). Of the 9 patients with alectinib failure, 5 had I1171 mutation and 2 had G1202R. Of the 11 patients with ceritinib failure, 2 had G1202R, 1 had F1174C, and 1 had both G1202R and F1174V. I1171 mutation, G1202R, and F1174 mutations were also found in crizotinib-failed patients.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nSome acquired ALK mutations may cause co-resistance to other ALK inhibitors. Re-biopsy for ALK mutation analysis might be suggested prior to choosing a second-line ALK inhibitor treatment.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"BACKGROUND\\nAnaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown efficacy in the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the disease eventually progresses in all patients. In many cases, resistance to ALK TKIs arises through ALK mutations. Although clinical and biological data suggest variations in TKI efficacy according to the mechanism of resistance, ALK mutations are still rarely investigated in routine practice.\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nWe performed a retrospective multicentric study with an aim to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of ALK alterations detected using targeted next-generation sequencing in patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC after progression during an ALK TKI treatment. Data on clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics and patient outcomes were collected.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nWe identified 23 patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC who, between January 2012 and May 2017, had undergone at least 1 repeat biopsy at progression during an ALK TKI treatment. A resistance mechanism was identified in 9 of the 23 patients (39%). The anomalies involved included 9 ALK mutations in 8 patients and one ALK amplification. The ALK mutation rate was 15% after failure of a first ALK TKI and 33% after failure of 2 ALK TKI treatments. Five of 7 patients who received a different ALK TKI after detection of an ALK mutation achieved an objective response. All of the patients who received a TKI presumed to act on the detected ALK mutant achieved disease control.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nTargeted next-generation sequencing is suitable for detecting ALK resistance mutations in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients in routine practice. It might help select the best treatment at the time of disease progression during treatment with an ALK TKI.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Genetic insight into the pathogenesis of lung cancer has paved the way for a new era in its treatment. Recently, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been identified as exerting a potent transforming effect through genetic rearrangement in patients with lung cancer. Preclinical and single-arm phase I studies have shown that patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be successfully treated with crizotinib. Furthermore, a phase III randomized study indicated that crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with NSCLC harboring the ALK rearrangement who had received 1 previous platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite the excellent efficacy of crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive (ALK(+)) lung cancer, resistance mechanisms--such as secondary mutations in the ALK gene, the activation of other oncogenes, and so on--have been identified as conferring resistance to crizotinib. Second-generation ALK inhibitors, such as alectinib and ceritinib, have been shown to be effective not only in crizotinib-naive patients but also in those resistant to crizotinib. Therefore, although some agents specifically targeting ALK have been developed and their efficacy has been documented, how ALK inhibitors should be administered in the setting of ALK-rearranged NSCLC remains to be fully elucidated. Can second-generation ALK inhibitors replace crizotinib? Is crizotinib just a first-generation ALK inhibitor? Is the sequential use of crizotinib and second-generation ALK inhibitors the best method? In this article, we review the preclinical and clinical results regarding crizotinib and second-generation ALK inhibitors, as well as the resistance mechanisms, and discuss the best methods for treating patients with ALK(+) NSCLC.\",\n",

Other than genomic alteration as a resistance mechanism, up to 10% of NSCLC with activating epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation showed resistance to EGFR TKI through histologic transformation. Although limited in number, there are cases showing transformed samples retaining the initial genomic alteration, which support lineage transition as a novel resistance mechanism.

      "      \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVES\\nAnaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been proven to be another driver oncogene that accounts for 3%-7% of non-small-cell lung cancer, and it is more common in young patients and nonsmokers. ALK rearrangements have been previously identified in about 5.1% of lung adenocarcinoma, including EML4-ALK fusion variants, KIF5B-ALK and TFG-ALK. However, a TNIP2-ALK fusion has not been reported in lung adenocarcinoma. Herein, we described a rare case of ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma responding to crizotinib.\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) assay and comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed on the aspirated biopsied tumor tissue.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe IHC analysis revealed an ALK-positive tumor, while NGS detected a TNIP2-ALK fusion. The patient achieved continuous remission after treatment with crizotinib (250\\u202fmg, twice a day).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis case provides valuable information on the response to crizotinib of patients with TNIP2-ALK fusion and better understanding of ALK-TKI applications in the future. NGS is a new method that can offer effective detection of gene fusion and gene mutations.\",\n",

A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane through July 17, 2017. Conference abstracts (three meetings in past 2 years) also were searched. Of 504 unique publications, 80 met inclusion criteria (47 clinical trials, 33 observational studies). Observational studies have the potential to provide information for ALK inhibitors used sequentially. Ten observational studies reported median overall survival of crizotinib-led sequences ranging from 30.3 to 63.75 months from initiation of crizotinib; 49.4-89.6 months from metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosis; and 15.5-22.0 months from initiation of the second-generation ALK inhibitor after initial crizotinib. Sequencing of ALK inhibitors may benefit patients progressing on initial ALK inhibitors.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an important molecular subgroup of tumors that are typically sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although a substantial portion of patients benefit from TKIs, this approach is complicated by intrinsic and acquired resistance. We report a patient with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who showed an initial response to targeted therapy, but developed resistance to multiple TKIs. Serial comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed at four independent points during the clinical course. We review the pathology and clonal progression of the tumor, with CGP identifying a secondary CTNNB1 p.S45V mutation after the initiation of targeted therapy, followed by tertiary ALK p.I1171N. The presence of an alteration in a second oncogenic driver gene suggests a possible mechanism for resistance, and a secondary therapeutic target. Due to the involvement of Wnt signaling in the pathogenesis of many tumors and its association with immune evasion, a variety of therapeutic strategies are being developed to target this pathway. This case exemplifies the challenges of targeted therapeutics in the face of tumor progression, as well as the increasing role of genomics in understanding tumor biology.\",\n",

      "METHODS\n",
      "We reviewed our experience in patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis who had heart-lung or double-lung transplantation between January 1988 and September 1997. Twenty-three patients (14 male, 21 cystic fibrosis) had heart-lung transplantation and 24 patients (8 male, 19 cystic fibrosis) had double-lung transplantation. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in age, weight, preoperative creatinine level, cytomegalovirus status, maintenance immunosuppression, or donor demographics. Patients received induction therapy with monoclonal (OKT3) or polyclonal (rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin) antibody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Sixteen of 24 patients had double-lung transplantation after 1994 whereas 13 of 22 patients had heart-lung transplantation before 1991, allowing longer follow-up for the heart-lung group. Mean waiting times for transplantation were 270 +/- 245 days (heart-lung) and 361 +/- 229 days (double-lung; P =.20). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival figures were respectively 86%, 82%, and 65% (heart-lung) and 96%, 75%, and unavailable (double-lung; P = no significant difference). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year rates of freedom from obliterative bronchiolitis were respectively 77%, 61%, and 45% (heart-lung) and 86%, 78%, and unavailable (double-lung; P = no significant difference). Linearized overall infection rates (events/100 patient-days) were 2.05 +/- 0.33 (heart-lung) and 2.34 +/- 0.34 (double-lung; P = NS) at 3 months. Thirty-day survival was 100% (heart-lung) and 96% (double-lung). There were 7 late deaths among heart-lung recipients (3 obliterative bronchiolitis, 2 infection, 0 graft coronary artery disease, 2 other) whereas 2 late deaths related to obliterative bronchiolitis occurred in double-lung recipients. Graft coronary artery disease (all stenoses < 50%) affected 15% of heart-lung survivors, whereas 3 double-lung recipients (12.5%) required either bronchial dilatation or stenting.\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "Heart-lung and double-lung transplantation provide similar palliation for patients with end-stage suppurative lung disease. Therefore double-lung transplantation should be the preferred operation for most patients with end-stage suppurative lung disease.\n",

      "Interstitial lung disease is a heterogeneous group of illnesses, some of which may progress to a fibrosing stage and cause respiratory failure. For selected candidates, lung transplantation is the ultimate therapeutic option. We review data on lung transplantation for various interstitial lung diseases. We address indications, procedures, and outcomes for patients undergoing transplantation. Unique issues affecting morbidity, mortality, and recurrence of disease are discussed. We review the literature of transplantation for specific interstitial lung diseases and the outcomes of transplantation for interstitial lung diseases. Candidates with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis experience high mortality on the waiting list, but derive significant survival benefit from lung transplantation. Recurrence is reported for several interstitial lung diseases after lung transplantation. Survival with lung transplantation for interstitial lung diseases is comparable with that attained in recipients with other indications. Lung transplantation is a well-tolerated, effective therapy for respiratory failure in interstitial lung disease.\n",

      "The use of stem cell biology approaches to study adult lung progenitor cells and lung cancer has brought a variety of new techniques to the field of lung biology and has elucidated new pathways that may be therapeutic targets in lung cancer. Recent results have begun to identify the ways in which different cell populations interact to regulate progenitor activity, and this has implications for the interventions that are possible in cancer and in a variety of lung diseases. Today's better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate lung progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation, including understanding how multiple epigenetic factors affect lung injury repair, holds the promise for future better treatments for lung cancer and for optimising the response to therapy in lung cancer. Working between platforms in sophisticated organoid culture techniques, genetically engineered mouse models of injury and cancer, and human cell lines and specimens, lung progenitor cell studies can begin with basic biology, progress to translational research and finally lead to the beginnings of clinical trials.\n",

      "Lung and heart-lung transplantation.\n",
      "Unilateral lung transplantation has become a successful method for the treatment of end-stage pulmonary disease, whereas double-lung transplantation has provided benefit to patients with nonfibrotic lung disease such as emphysema and cystic fibrosis. In the past 5 years, 16 single-lung and 13 double-lung transplantations have been performed by the Toronto Lung Transplant Group in patients with end-stage lung disease. Seven perioperative and two late deaths have been recorded so far. Since the introduction of heart-lung transplantation at Stanford in 1981 and at Pittsburgh in 1982 for the treatment of Eisenmenger's syndrome and terminal pulmonary vascular disease, more than 350 combined heart-lung transplantations have been carried out throughout the world. Presently, the 2-year actuarial survival is about 62%. The long-term results have not yet reached the same level of success as those of cardiac transplantation alone. Although several factors have played a role in this difference, a prominent cause has been the lack of a reliable and simple method for pulmonary protection against prolonged ischemia. Most of the techniques proposed against ischemia can be classified as normothermic or static hypothermic cardiopulmonary preservation. The use of the normothermic method has not always been successful. For this reason, interest has now been directed toward the potential for hypothermic preservation of the heart-lung bloc and the use of free-radical scavenger therapy in the reduction of reperfusion injury.\n",

      "With the increase in the number of lung transplants, it is expected that there will be a corresponding increase in the number of lung cancers reported in these patients. Longevity of the transplant recipients, lung transplantation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a history of smoking, and the increasing age of the lung donors make lung cancer more likely. Nodules and masses seen in chest imaging in lung transplant patients call for work up until a final diagnosis is achieved because there is a high likelihood of a serious infection or malignancy. The presence of a native lung is a major risk factor for lung cancer occurring in the transplant setting. Lung cancer of donor origin is rare. Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma confined to one lung can potentially be treated by transplanting the affected lung. Treatment for patients with lung cancer in the lung transplant setting has to be individualized because of the complexity of their medical problems and multiple medications. Attention needs to be focused on detecting lung cancer early in these patients to achieve a favorable outcome.\n",
